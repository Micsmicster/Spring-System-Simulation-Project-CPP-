# CPTR 142: Project III â€“ Spring-Mass-Damper Simulation

## Project Description
This project simulates the behavior of a **spring-mass-damper system** by modeling the motion of a mass attached to a spring with damping. The system is governed by a **second-order differential equation**, and numerical methods are used to compute its response over time. In this coding assignment we are tasked to code in C++ and use git to save our work.



### Features
- Add new springs with specific **spring constant (k), damping coefficient (c), and mass (m)**.
- Simulate the motion of the system based on user-defined **time step (Î”t) and total duration (s)**.
- Display all stored spring systems.

### Main Menu Options
- 1. Add a new spring (enter values for k, c, and m).
- 2. Display all stored springs.
- 3. Simulate the motion for a given duration of **time step (Î”t) and total duration (s)**.
- 4. Exit the Program

### Simulation Parameters
- The program asks for a time step (Î”t) and total simulation duration.
- The simulation computes displacement over time using Eulerâ€™s method.
- Recommended Time Step (Î”t â‰¤ 0.1s) to ensure accurate results.

### Known Issues & Bugs
- Large time steps (Î”t > 0.1s) may cause numerical instability.
- The program does not validate invalid user inputs well.
- The numerical method used (Eulerâ€™s Method) introduces small approximation errors.

### Future Improvements
- Implement graphical plots to visualize spring motion.
- Improve error handling for invalid inputs.
- Allow users to input initial displacement and velocity.
- Allow users to solve for k, c, or mass if they are unkown.
- Allow users to use file handling features

## Project Summary

- This Spring-Mass-Damper Simulation project showcases my ability to implement object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++ while utilizing numerical methods to simulate physical systems. It includes features like dynamic spring addition, simulation of motion using Eulerâ€™s method, input validation, and file handling.

- Throughout this project, I worked extensively on designing the system architecture, writing efficient C++ code, handling user input validation, and implementing numerical simulations. I also utilized GitLab for version control and collaboration.

- This project demonstrates my problem-solving skills, proficiency in C++, and ability to write structured, maintainable code. Future improvements could include graphical plots, improved numerical methods, better error handling, and more efficint file handling.
